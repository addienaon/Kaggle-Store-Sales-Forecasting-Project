# Store Sales Forecasting Project
Store Sales Forecasting Project - a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of an ongoing [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) hosted by Kaggle. The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict grocery store sales accurately. 

It's important to note that this project has been a learning experience for me, and as such, the notebooks showcase imperfections and flaws encountered along the way.

## Notebooks

- **Boosted Hybrid StoreSales.ipynb**: This notebook represents one of the initial attempts at solving the problem. It's worth noting that there were significant residuals observed when comparing the predicted values with the actual sales data in this checkpoint.

- **Boosted Hybrid StoreSales_ver3.ipynb**: This notebook represents my third submission, reflecting the iterative improvements and fine-tuning undertaken to enhance predictive performance. It demonstrates the progress made in tackling the forecasting challenge.

- **DrawSQL.PNG**: A visual artifact showcasing an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) diagram, aiding in comprehending intricate data relationships within the context of the project.

- **DataExploration**: A dedicated space for notebooks focused on dataset exploration. These notebooks encapsulate my insights, observations, and preliminary trends discovered during the initial exploration phase.

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.ipynb**: Notes compiled during the learning phase, specifically pertaining to eigenvalues and eigenvectors, underlying mathematical concepts.

- **MissingData.ipynb**: A deep dive into the intricacies of missing data within the dataset. This notebook outlines my thorough analysis and explores potential strategies to handle missing values effectively.

- **PCA- statquest.ipynb**: A Notes compiled during the learning phase, specifically pertaining to Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

- **Forecast-2017_cubic_tend.ipynb**: This notebook encapsulates a submission strategy focused on effectively fitting the training data. It also delves into exploring feature importance.

- **StoresSales_TimeSeries.ipynb**: A cornerstone reference point for comprehending the preprocessing and model training aspects of time series analysis for store sales forecasting.
